# Machine-Learning-and-Neural-Networks-on-Minesweeper
Machine learning algorithms and neural networks were tested on minesweeper in this project.

Machine learning algorithms that are tested in this project are:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Machine

For each model, 1000 automated game were played using the trained models. The results are:
### Neural Networks

- **Games played**: 1000
- **Games won**: 749
- **Win percentage**: 74.90%
- **Safe move percentage**: 97.28%

- ### Random Forest

- **Games played**: 1000
- **Games won**: 683
- **Win percentage**: 68.30%
- **Safe move percentage**: 96.85%

  ### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

- **Games played**: 1000
- **Games won**: 573
- **Win percentage**: 57.30%
- **Safe move percentage**: 96.07%

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

- **Games played**: 1000
- **Games won**: 571
- **Win percentage**: 57.10%
- **Safe move percentage**: 95.10%
